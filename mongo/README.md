# Assignment2
The Database APP for Mongo

## Description
Okay so this really is pretty much the same as the original assignment python code wise really the primary changes that were done had to do with the connecting to it and how to read through the database. As a result I was able to reuse most of the code and the comments are likely from before. Running the program it looks identical. The biggest challenge to getting this to work was honestly installing mongo verifiying that it was there and then figuring out how to use mongo's import CSV function to get that as the database. To do this it litterally has a mongoimport which is used to upload CSV to the mongo database. After figuring out how to do that which took a couple hours I was finally able to get the satisfaction of the program actually running like the mysql version.

**Note a lot of the comments are also still the mysql comments but are similiar enough to still get the point in the program.
