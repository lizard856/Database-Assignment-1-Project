# Results
So apparently after reading the big overview pdf I missed the fact that the each individual folder had it's own readme. I uploaded the app an docs and when I got to the results realized why I really struggling on the direction to take with the project. I didn't realize the results tab was where the real important part was. As a result I think my project still follows everything else but I did decide to create another small python file for some results similiar to what that readme had and they are listed below:
1. 0 to 9 -> 33830
2. average total checkouts: 193
3. average total renewals: 71

# Others
As far as the my main implementation I believe I was storing the data correctly and allowing you to be able to choose what data you wanted as the main export. In retrospect I would design my app differently to be a user interface to get these sort of results. Overall though I'm happy with what I was able to create it took me WAY longer than I thought it would, but I guess that comes with multiple things in this project being fairly new to me.
